# ===== OPTION 1: Cloudflare Worker (RECOMMENDED for Production) =====
# Use this for production deployment - keeps API keys secure on Cloudflare's edge
# Deploy the worker from /cloudflare-worker/ directory first
# Then set your Worker URL here:
VITE_NEWSLETTER_WORKER_URL=

# Example: VITE_NEWSLETTER_WORKER_URL=https://newsletter-proxy.your-account.workers.dev
# Or with custom domain: VITE_NEWSLETTER_WORKER_URL=https://api.publicpresence.org

# ===== OPTION 2: Direct Kit API (Development/Testing Only) =====
# Only use this for local development - NOT recommended for production
# as it exposes your API key in the client-side code

# Your Kit API key (from kit.com → Settings → Advanced → API)
VITE_KIT_API_KEY=

# Your Kit form ID (from the form's publish URL, e.g., f990e0e0b9)
VITE_KIT_FORM_ID=

# NOTE: If VITE_NEWSLETTER_WORKER_URL is set, it takes precedence over direct API
