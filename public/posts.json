Let's talk about that.\n\n## Frustration and Heartache\n\nThere is something especially soul crushing about missing a connection\nduring a commute home after a long day, especially when you get the horrible\nopportunity to watch your bus or train close the doors and depart without you\njust after dashing widely through the subway or terminal to try to make it just\nin time. The agony of standing in the rain, or snow, or, even worse, an \nEast-Coast summer. Every commuter knows these frustrations and heartaches like\nthey were born with them. And yet, some of us would rather face these pains\nthan have to spend a moment driving in Manhattan, on the Parkway, or on\nthe Turnpike.\n\n## Better Than You Think\n\nDespite our shared experience of sisyphean moving from Point A to Point\nZ, public transportation is still a masterpiece of engineering and public\nservices. For example, [NJ TRANSIT Rail](https://www.njtransit.com/improve/on-time-performance/rail) _On-Time Performance_, at the time of writing this,\nis a healthy 92.1%. Now, does it feel any better knowing that when you are the\nunlucky 7.9% waving goodbye to the 5:21 PM from Hoboken (like I often am)?\nDefinitely not. But there is something incredible about those trains, buses,\nand light-rail locomotives showing up **at all**. Thousands of public transportation\nworkers across the country, getting up early, staying late - mechanics, engineers,\nconductors, bus operators, logistics teams, on and on. All of these teams\nworking in tandem to move millions of Americans to and from job, friends, and family\nday in and day out, rain or snow or shine. After Hurricane Sandy, NJ TRANSIT\nwas a front-line, first-responder for transporting people to and from New Jersey\nand New York City under \"dark sky\" operations.\n\n## So, what's my point?\n\nMy point is this: public transportation is, without a doubt, is the backbone\nof American economics **and** serves as more than just as a way of getting from\none place to another. Couple this critical economic service with the fact that\npublic transportation is a more energy and emissions efficient mode of\ntransportation than single-passenger vehicles and it becomes clear just what we\nare missing out on by _not_ investing in maintaining existing infrastructure, \npersonnel resources, and building new infrastructure to serve first- and last-mile\ntransportation needs.\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you're a voter, a local official, a commuter, or even just want fewer people on the\nroad so you can drive your car to the office, make your voice heard in the public \ncommons by speaking up at local and State hearings! We can all benefit from these \nrenewed community services and enjoy a better commute, together.\n",

This blog represents my commitment to contributing to evidence-based discussions about building more sustainable and equitable public systems.\n\n## What to Expect\n\nThrough this platform, I'll be sharing insights from my work in greenhouse gas accounting and public sector sustainability, discussing emerging research and best practices, and exploring the complex challenges facing our cities and transportation systems.\n\n### Key Topics\n\nThe content here will focus on several interconnected themes:\n\n1. **Public Transportation** - Policy, planning, and operations for sustainable transit systems\n2. **Sustainability Science** - Research-driven approaches to environmental challenges\n3. **Public Policy** - Evidence-based policy development for climate action\n4. **Urban Planning** - Creating resilient, sustainable cities\n\n## A Note on Approach\n\nThroughout my career in public service, I've been committed to rigorous, data-driven approaches to sustainability challenges. This blog will reflect that commitment by grounding discussions in research, data, and practical experience.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nI'm excited to use this platform to contribute to important conversations about sustainability, equity, and public service. The views expressed here are my own and don't necessarily reflect those of my employer or any other organization.\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more insights in future posts.\n\n---\n\n_Have thoughts or questions?
