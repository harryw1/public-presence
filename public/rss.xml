# Public Transportation and You

When trains are delayed, buses are stuck in traffic, and our communities clogged with traffic,
it can feel like our public transportation systems are failing us. Let's talk about that.

## Frustration and Heartache

There is something especially soul crushing about missing a connection
during a commute home after a long day, especially when you get the horrible
opportunity to watch your bus or train close the doors and depart without you
just after dashing widely through the subway or terminal to try to make it just
in time. The agony of standing in the rain, or snow, or, even worse, an 
East-Coast summer. Every commuter knows these frustrations and heartaches like
they were born with them. And yet, some of us would rather face these pains
than have to spend a moment driving in Manhattan, on the Parkway, or on
the Turnpike.

## Better Than You Think

Despite our shared experience of sisyphean moving from Point A to Point
Z, public transportation is still a masterpiece of engineering and public
services. For example, [NJ TRANSIT Rail](https://www.njtransit.com/improve/on-time-performance/rail) _On-Time Performance_, at the time of writing this,
is a healthy 92.1%. Now, does it feel any better knowing that when you are the
unlucky 7.9% waving goodbye to the 5:21 PM from Hoboken (like I often am)?
Definitely not. But there is something incredible about those trains, buses,
and light-rail locomotives showing up **at all**. Thousands of public transportation
workers across the country, getting up early, staying late - mechanics, engineers,
conductors, bus operators, logistics teams, on and on. All of these teams
working in tandem to move millions of Americans to and from job, friends, and family
day in and day out, rain or snow or shine. After Hurricane Sandy, NJ TRANSIT
was a front-line, first-responder for transporting people to and from New Jersey
and New York City under "dark sky" operations.

## So, what's my point?

My point is this: public transportation is, without a doubt, is the backbone
of American economics **and** serves as more than just as a way of getting from
one place to another. Couple this critical economic service with the fact that
public transportation is a more energy and emissions efficient mode of
transportation than single-passenger vehicles and it becomes clear just what we
are missing out on by _not_ investing in maintaining existing infrastructure, 
personnel resources, and building new infrastructure to serve first- and last-mile
transportation needs.

## Conclusion

If you're a voter, a local official, a commuter, or even just want fewer people on the
road so you can drive your car to the office, make your voice heard in the public 
commons by speaking up at local and State hearings! We can all benefit from these 
renewed community services and enjoy a better commute, together.

# Welcome to Public Presence

Welcome to Public Presence, a space dedicated to exploring the intersection of sustainability science, public planning, policy, and public transportation. This blog represents my commitment to contributing to evidence-based discussions about building more sustainable and equitable public systems.

## What to Expect

Through this platform, I'll be sharing insights from my work in greenhouse gas accounting and public sector sustainability, discussing emerging research and best practices, and exploring the complex challenges facing our cities and transportation systems.

### Key Topics

The content here will focus on several interconnected themes:

1. **Public Transportation** - Policy, planning, and operations for sustainable transit systems
2. **Sustainability Science** - Research-driven approaches to environmental challenges
3. **Public Policy** - Evidence-based policy development for climate action
4. **Urban Planning** - Creating resilient, sustainable cities

## A Note on Approach

Throughout my career in public service, I've been committed to rigorous, data-driven approaches to sustainability challenges. This blog will reflect that commitment by grounding discussions in research, data, and practical experience.

## Moving Forward

I'm excited to use this platform to contribute to important conversations about sustainability, equity, and public service. The views expressed here are my own and don't necessarily reflect those of my employer or any other organization.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more insights in future posts.
