# Welcome to Public Presence

Welcome to Public Presence, a space dedicated to exploring the intersection of sustainability science, public planning, policy, and public transportation. This blog represents my commitment to contributing to evidence-based discussions about building more sustainable and equitable public systems.

## What to Expect

Through this platform, I'll be sharing insights from my work in greenhouse gas accounting and public sector sustainability, discussing emerging research and best practices, and exploring the complex challenges facing our cities and transportation systems.

### Key Topics

The content here will focus on several interconnected themes:

1. **Greenhouse Gas Accounting** - Methodologies, challenges, and innovations in measuring and tracking emissions
2. **Public Transportation** - Policy, planning, and operations for sustainable transit systems
3. **Sustainability Science** - Research-driven approaches to environmental challenges
4. **Public Policy** - Evidence-based policy development for climate action
5. **Urban Planning** - Creating resilient, sustainable cities

## A Note on Approach

Throughout my career in public service, I've been committed to rigorous, data-driven approaches to sustainability challenges. This blog will reflect that commitment by grounding discussions in research, data, and practical experience.

## Math and Code

When needed, I'll include mathematical equations to explain concepts. For example, calculating emissions factors:

$$
E = A \\times EF
$$

Where:
- $E$ = Total emissions
- $A$ = Activity data
- $EF$ = Emission factor

I may also share code snippets and technical approaches:

```python
def calculate_emissions(activity_data, emission_factor):
    """
    Calculate total emissions from activity data and emission factor.
    
    Args:
        activity_data (float): Amount of activity (e.g., kWh, miles)
        emission_factor (float): Emissions per unit of activity
    
    Returns:
        float: Total emissions
    """
    return activity_data * emission_factor

# Example usage
electricity_kwh = 10000
ef_electricity = 0.000744  # metric tons CO2e per kWh (US grid average)
emissions = calculate_emissions(electricity_kwh, ef_electricity)
print(f"Total emissions: {emissions:.2f} metric tons CO2e")
```

## Moving Forward

I'm excited to use this platform to contribute to important conversations about sustainability, equity, and public service. The views expressed here are my own and don't necessarily reflect those of my employer or any other organization.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more insights in future posts.
