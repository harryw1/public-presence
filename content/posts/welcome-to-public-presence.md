# Welcome to Public Presence

Welcome to Public Presence, a space dedicated to exploring the intersection of sustainability science, public planning, policy, and public transportation. This blog represents my commitment to contributing to evidence-based discussions about building more sustainable and equitable public systems.

## What to Expect

Through this platform, I'll be sharing insights from my work in greenhouse gas accounting and public sector sustainability, discussing emerging research and best practices, and exploring the complex challenges facing our cities and transportation systems.

### Key Topics

The content here will focus on several interconnected themes:

1. **Public Transportation** - Policy, planning, and operations for sustainable transit systems
2. **Sustainability Science** - Research-driven approaches to environmental challenges
3. **Public Policy** - Evidence-based policy development for climate action
4. **Urban Planning** - Creating resilient, sustainable cities

## A Note on Approach

Throughout my career in public service, I've been committed to rigorous, data-driven approaches to sustainability challenges. This blog will reflect that commitment by grounding discussions in research, data, and practical experience.

## Moving Forward

I'm excited to use this platform to contribute to important conversations about sustainability, equity, and public service. The views expressed here are my own and don't necessarily reflect those of my employer or any other organization.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more insights in future posts.
