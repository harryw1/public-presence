# Your Post Title Here

Your introduction paragraph goes here. This should hook the reader and provide context for what you'll be discussing.

## Main Section Heading

Your content goes here. You can use all standard Markdown features:

### Subsection

- Bullet points
- Like this
- Are supported

1. Numbered lists
2. Also work
3. Just fine

**Bold text** and *italic text* are available.

## Code Examples

Inline code: `variable_name` or `function_call()`

Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```python
def example_function(parameter):
    """
    Docstring explaining what the function does.
    """
    result = parameter * 2
    return result

# Usage
output = example_function(21)
print(f"The answer is: {output}")
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function calculateTotal(items) {
    return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}

const items = [
    { name: 'Item 1', price: 10 },
    { name: 'Item 2', price: 20 }
];

console.log(`Total: $${calculateTotal(items)}`);
```

## Mathematical Equations

Inline math: $E = mc^2$ or $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

Block math equations:

$$
\text{Total Emissions} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{Activity Data}_i \times \text{Emission Factor}_i)
$$

More complex equation:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

## Tables

| Category | Description | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Scope 1 | Direct emissions | 1,234 |
| Scope 2 | Purchased energy | 5,678 |
| Scope 3 | Indirect emissions | 9,012 |

## Images

To add images, place them in the `public/images/` directory and reference them:
